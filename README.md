# Dataset
- negative_samples: images of objects that are not of interest
- positive_knife_samples: ONLY positive images that have been resized to 120x160 and should be used to create HOG descriptors
- knife_test_samples: images to be used for testing
- **NOTE** : There are no negative samples in 'positive_knife_samples' or 'knife_test_samples'. They were left out to make labeling for the classifier and CNN easier. Its cool with me if you add them all together. I wasn't sure what would be easier for you all.
